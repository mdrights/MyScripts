2017-11-01 15:48:39	pastly	the game would have to come with Tor or expect Tor to be installed already. It would need permission to talk to tor's control port to tell it to open an onion service.
2017-11-01 15:49:08	khaleesi2	you just open the game while you have tor socks5 open, and the game would programmatically open up a tor hidden service

2017-11-02 14:46:32	Parckwart	i just read prop279 and wondered if it was a good idea to specify that if DNSPort is enabled in torrc and it is used to resolve sth like reddit.zkey.onion
2017-11-02 14:46:55	Parckwart	it wouldn't return an ip address, but a cname to the onion address instead
2017-11-02 14:47:13	Parckwart	is that a stupid idea?
2017-11-02 14:47:29	Parckwart	because it might give applications some insight into what's going on.

2017-11-02 14:49:20	dgoulet	Parckwart: hmmm iirc, I think in the case of a .onion, tor takes over because that is a reserved thing for Tor 
2017-11-02 14:49:38	dgoulet	Parckwart: there is an interesting challenge of defining a .onion plugin that can return a .onion :)
2017-11-02 14:49:41	dgoulet	(loop)
2017-11-02 14:50:17	dgoulet	probably as simple as doing no recursion with one plugin
2017-11-02 14:50:57	Parckwart	nothing would change for the plugin specification, just Tor would handle DNS request differenly
2017-11-02 14:51:35	dgoulet	yeah I guess a plugin for .onion is not something that can't be envision
2017-11-02 14:54:22	Parckwart	are we talking about the same thing? i mean that if i ask Tor's DNSPort the address of reddit.zkey.onion, I don't get sth like "10.236.232.112", but instead "reddit.zkey.onion is an alias for jqkscnkne4qt91iq.onion."
2017-11-02 14:55:32	dgoulet	Parckwart: OH!... maybe were weren't lol... so basically you propose to have the DNSPort also try to go through the NamingPlugin API, I think that is totally reasonable 
2017-11-02 14:55:37	dgoulet	is that it?

2017-11-07 12:56:35	cacahuatl	I think Tor handles SIGINT gracefully anyway, right?

2017-11-07 13:12:05	narco_	aha! that explains it
2017-11-07 13:12:18	narco_	used a script i wrote to do automatic updates. guess i should change it a bit
2017-11-07 13:12:55	narco_	is the recommended version always going to be the first json entry with -Linux appended to it?

2017-11-09 02:49:31	cacahuatl	with 0.3.2.4-alpha built from dist.torproject.org with just ./configure && make

2017-11-09 02:51:47	cacahuatl	The guide on the wiki has worked fine for me in the past though.
2017-11-09 02:52:56	Menche	Tor 0.3.2.4-alpha (git-940308f493edd10f) running on FreeBSD with Libevent 2.1.8-stable, OpenSSL LibreSSL 2.6.2, Zlib 1.2.11, Liblzma 5.2.3, and Libzstd 1.3.2.

2017-11-09 02:54:37	Menche	aside from being on FreeBSD, I see I have a different OpenSSL implementation than yours and have Libzstd
2017-11-09 02:54:48	TorIsFun	cacahuatl: I can see in iptables that packets are arriving at the proxy, but I guess they never get back to the client
2017-11-09 02:55:39	Menche	maybe something is different in LibreSSL preventing Tor from connecting to the HSDirs
2017-11-09 02:56:14	cacahuatl	Menche: what does `date -u` report? (does BSD have date -u? the time in UTC)
2017-11-09 02:56:21	Menche	it did work before though

2017-11-15 04:22:33	absol	keeps saying server is down. 
2017-11-15 04:23:04	cacahuatl	because the server thinks its 127.0.0.1, so the client wont know what host to connect to, to make the data connection

2017-11-15 07:27:18	Raikou	they are seperated and on different location on my computer,but yeah i usually run tor browser and tor.exe at the same time since my irc client is configured to use the tor.exe when connecting
2017-11-15 07:28:04	GeKo	alright. do you get tor browser to start when you install a fesh copy to a different location?

2017-11-15 07:29:22	GeKo	yes, i am trying to figure out what is wrong in your case
2017-11-15 07:29:50	GeKo	so could you test putting a new tor browser on the desktop into a different folder and starting it?

2017-11-15 07:30:59	Raikou	not sure,because idk where the Tor browser usually should b. but im waiting for the windows update first before anything else
2017-11-15 07:31:44	GeKo	okay. if you start the installer it let's you pick a location, just change the folder slightly there
2017-11-15 07:32:24	Raikou	alrighty,I will. I'll get back to u once the windows update is done and tell if anything happened.. and same when installing Tor browser again and after. might take awhile though
2017-11-15 07:32:37	GeKo	thanks
2017-11-15 07:33:21	Raikou	Just a weird question. will it ever be as fast as a normal non-tor browser? and if not.. is there any way to make the Tor browser faster?

2017-11-15 11:24:38	gain	irl: sry, incomplete question due to an interruption XD
2017-11-15 11:25:27	gain	I've seen that there's only a browser while I want to connect other applications through tor, like windows update, for example...
2017-11-15 11:25:46	gain	is there a client or something?
2017-11-15 11:25:50	irl	?otherbrowser

2017-11-15 11:26:28	pastly	Do your updates __really__ need to go over Tor?
2017-11-15 11:26:42	irl	?otherbrowser
2017-11-15 11:26:43	metrics-bot	We strongly recommend against using Tor in any browser other than Tor Browser. Using Tor in another browser can leave you pretty vulnerable; you don't get nearly the same privacy protections that you get when using Tor Browser.
2017-11-15 11:27:04	gain	irl: ok, thanks for the hint
2017-11-15 11:27:18	irl	also, doing windows update over tor while it sounds good, will probably leak things that would break the anonymity
2017-11-15 11:27:39	irl	windows update reports telemetry (good guess, don't know for sure) back to the update servers that could be used to identify you
2017-11-15 11:27:46	irl	probably also anti-piracy measures do the same
2017-11-15 11:28:13	gain	pastly: just a try for technical problems... I have a line where updates not works while through my phone hotspot works... I thinks that the ip is in blacklist or something but I can't update all from my phone, not enough traffic available...
2017-11-15 11:28:19	irl	we do support things like debian updates over tor but this isn't done as a hack but as a thought out system, where the holes have been plugged
2017-11-15 11:28:53	irl	bottom line, unless the application knows it's using tor specifically, you get very questionable benefit from it
2017-11-15 11:29:00	gain	irl: cool
2017-11-15 11:30:09	gain	irl: and something like irc over tor?

2017-11-15 15:09:05	duncan	There isn't much benefit from running Tails in a VM at all
2017-11-15 15:09:30	duncan	You sound like you're going Tor -> VPN. Don't do that. 
2017-11-15 15:09:57	lucid	For me the perceived benefits were: I only have one box at the moment, and not knowing more about Tor, I figured Tails was setup better than anything I could install myself.
2017-11-15 15:09:59	duncan	Stop running Tor in VMs behind VPNs, if that's what you're doing (it sounds like this)
2017-11-15 15:10:21	lucid	I'm going Ubuntu->VPN, and there's a Tails VM in ubuntu.
2017-11-15 15:10:31	lucid	Isn't that VPN->Tor?
2017-11-15 15:10:37	duncan	so you're going VPN -> Tor, right
2017-11-15 15:10:53	duncan	that's not really of much benefit
2017-11-15 15:11:21	duncan	Just run Tails from some USB drive or CD
2017-11-15 15:12:18	pastly	I mean, there's the benefit of being able to use Tails and something else at the same time.
2017-11-15 15:12:29	lucid	If Tails isn't doing much, would I be better off just running Tor browser from Ubuntu, or using the Whonix gateway for another Linux VM (or Whonix Workstation) for any private browsing?

2017-11-15 20:13:57	duncan	proxychains performs DNS lookups outside the proxy by default, or at least it did so historically (and probably leaks in other ways)
2017-11-15 20:15:58	duncan	also, if you're doing it for nefarious reasons ("pentesting over tor") then you are stupid and deserve whatever happens to you

2017-11-16 00:03:14	tydynrain	Hi all. I have a rather annoying problem on Ubuntu concerning the latest update of tor from the torproject.org repositories. Every time I allow tor and tor-geoip to update, it breaks tor. Somehow the permissions get changed which renders tor inoperable. I've tried all sorts of things to fix the situation, all to no avail. I keep backups of my hard drive, and have to keep restoring the Ubuntu partition. I just disabled the 
2017-11-16 00:03:14	tydynrain	torproject.org repository until I can find a solution. This problem does not exist in Arch Linux, or even Windows 10.
2017-11-16 00:03:18	sukhe	your local time on your computer should be correct, yes

2017-11-16 00:05:30	tydynrain	The permissions for /etc/tor/torrc get changed to root, as well as it's /var/lib/tor files. I manually change them back to debian-tor, but that does not help.

2017-11-16 00:06:45	tydynrain	it starts as root, then switches to debian-tor, at least that's how it's supposed to work.
2017-11-16 00:06:47	duncan	shouldn't it just need to be readable anyway by debian-tor?

2017-11-16 00:07:16	cacahuatl	and yeah, debian-tor just needs read permissions
2017-11-16 00:07:42	cacahuatl	otherwise anyone with access to Tor's control port gets root code execution
2017-11-16 00:07:46	cacahuatl	which you probably don't want
2017-11-16 00:08:36	tydynrain	On Arch linux I have 2 tor.d drop in files, one to increase file desciptors for my relay, and a second to start tor as root, and in the torrc I have user=tor, which works in Arch. I ported that to Ubuntu, which also uses Systemd, and it works fine until I upgrade tor.

2017-11-16 03:00:01	gemmalearner	I'm looking for a decently comprehensive tutorial on how to have VM and force all of the traffic to route through Tor externally. I want to eliminate the possibility of an IP leak. 
2017-11-16 03:01:15	cacahuatl	you could look at existing solutions like Qubes or Whonix?
2017-11-16 03:02:05	gemmalearner	I don't trust whonix
2017-11-16 03:02:34	gemmalearner	I like the idea of Qubes though
2017-11-16 03:03:17	gemmalearner	I essentially just want to set up the same thing as what whonix does with it's workstation and gateway.
2017-11-16 03:03:25	cacahuatl	Qubes gives you an option to enforce Tor usage when you install it
2017-11-16 03:04:17	gemmalearner	I'd rather stick with ubuntu though but that is a nice feature
2017-11-16 03:05:28	velope	there never really exists any such "decently comprehensive tutorial"
2017-11-16 03:05:54	velope	there's too many linux variations, too many differences in what people want to do and how they want to do it
2017-11-16 03:06:35	velope	you just have to google (or whatever search) for some, read, compare, investigate, experiment, test, until you understand
2017-11-16 03:08:09	velope	step zero (or thereabouts), understand that "force all the traffic through tor" is generally not a good idea, and is not how tails does it.

2017-11-16 07:55:50	Littlefeather	i thought i should do that :) disabled exit atm :(
2017-11-16 07:57:49	bentham	Yea, please test it once you get it up to confirm it works.  When you're satisfied, please feel free to post it here so that others can learn.
2017-11-16 07:58:04	bentham	It seems like a recurring enquiry these days.

2017-11-17 01:42:13	kyeho	Hello, I was wondering if I could get some insight or linked to docs on more info regarding how things like torify and torsocks work. My limited understanding is its a preloaded lib that hooks calls for host lookups like gethostbyname. I sort of understand the socks protocol in the sense that it will "wrap" a request and the socks proxy will unwrap the request and make the actual request for the client. I do not understand on a TCP level what address a program using 
2017-11-17 01:42:13	kyeho	torify / torsocks would get back. Meaning if I were to do torify curl google.com, does the preloaded lib catch the lookup, wrap it in socks send it along to the exit node which then does the actual DNS resolution and HTTP request? If that is the case what IP is returned to curl? is a 127.0.0.1?
2017-11-17 01:43:11	kyeho	I guess im not so much asking about the resolution because I think I understand that being forwarded to the exit node, but im wondering what IP is given to curl to make its request

2017-11-17 01:57:12	kyeho	thanks ertosns_ I think I understand that part as described above but I think im missing the HOW it does it, as in what is "socksifying" when those hooks are in place what does that look like to an application

2017-11-17 01:58:10	kyeho	hrm
2017-11-17 01:58:52	kyeho	so curl would create a packet destined to 127.0.0.1 on port 9050?

2017-11-17 01:59:26	ertosns_	and hijack systemcalls
2017-11-17 01:59:43	kyeho	Right but, dont those sys calls return things like and IP to a program?
2017-11-17 01:59:47	kyeho	like gethostbyname
2017-11-17 02:00:11	kyeho	would return and IP to an application which would then create a tcp packet destined to that IP no?

2017-11-17 02:16:04	rabbitear	kyeho, if you have trouble with torsocks with some programs you can try proxychains which is a similar type of program

2017-11-17 02:23:13	rabbitear	its doesnt now
2017-11-17 02:23:24	rabbitear	it has a setting for proxy dns
2017-11-17 02:23:39	rabbitear	and i tested with firefox recently and the dns was the proxy
2017-11-17 02:23:52	cacahuatl	it doesnt work any differently from torsocks
2017-11-17 02:24:02	cacahuatl	except it's more likely to result in leaks
2017-11-17 02:25:05	rabbitear	well ive tried it on some programs and it didnt seem to work well
2017-11-17 02:25:09	rabbitear	i can try it again
2017-11-17 02:25:23	rabbitear	whats the command torsocks program?

2017-11-17 02:25:36	uupz	btw i love tor/proxychains
2017-11-17 02:25:37	cacahuatl	places where it doesnt work and proxychains does, is a case where leaks might happen
2017-11-17 02:25:55	rabbitear	not for me so far
2017-11-17 02:26:09	rabbitear	torify is the command?
2017-11-17 02:26:10	uupz	im currently enrolled in a LAN systems with spec in security...we are currently learning about nmap and exploring tor/proxychains
2017-11-17 02:26:32	uupz	where are you checking for leaks?
2017-11-17 02:26:39	uupz	i use it with nmap
2017-11-17 02:26:41	rabbitear	i think the dns leak is an old issue and yes it can leak on certain programs but when it works and it usually does fine
2017-11-17 02:26:45	rabbitear	rofl
2017-11-17 02:27:05	uupz	in a sandbox...
2017-11-17 02:27:07	rabbitear	well they were talking about leaks but 
2017-11-17 02:27:26	rabbitear	uupz, have you seen any leaks with proxychains and nmap?
2017-11-17 02:27:47	uupz	welll
2017-11-17 02:27:56	uupz	i've only scanned internal ips
2017-11-17 02:28:05	uupz	allow me to scan you and you tell me if you see my ip?
2017-11-17 02:28:08	rabbitear	sure you have :)
2017-11-17 02:28:08	uupz	im curious...
2017-11-17 02:28:24	cacahuatl	rabbitear: not just dns leaks
2017-11-17 02:28:35	rabbitear	well i know you need to be careful with the commands especially on windows cause you dont want raw sockets
2017-11-17 02:28:41	uupz	no
2017-11-17 02:28:44	cacahuatl	but, for example, the program communicating with local services which aren't using tor
2017-11-17 02:28:44	uupz	you use -sT
2017-11-17 02:28:50	rabbitear	non root on linux probably wont do raw sockets
2017-11-17 02:28:50	rabbitear	yes

2017-11-17 02:29:25	uupz	yes\
2017-11-17 02:29:29	rabbitear	bitch you crazy
2017-11-17 02:29:30	uupz	tor-resolve works
2017-11-17 02:29:33	uupz	why?
2017-11-17 02:29:49	rabbitear	you think im going to hand you my ip? lol
2017-11-17 02:30:07	uupz	im not going to do shit with it, but i understand your paranoia
2017-11-17 02:30:22	rabbitear	yes you can use tor-resolve but dns proxy in proxychains works with tor too i just testing like 2 days ago in firefox
2017-11-17 02:30:36	uupz	ok so when i scanned my internal ip
2017-11-17 02:30:45	uupz	i had laptop setup next to my pc

2017-11-17 02:31:10	uupz	my source ip was 192.168.0.100 i used proxychains and noone of the ips were on the firewall
2017-11-17 02:31:22	uupz	however using ipchicken.com and dnsleak.com there were no leaks
2017-11-17 02:31:34	rabbitear	what source ip is that?
2017-11-17 02:31:43	uupz	vmware
2017-11-17 02:31:53	uupz	i made sure they could ping each other too 
2017-11-17 02:31:59	uupz	so it wasn't a connection issue
2017-11-17 02:32:04	rabbitear	you use proxychains or no?
2017-11-17 02:32:08	uupz	192.168.0.100 showed up on the firewall
2017-11-17 02:32:11	uupz	yes
2017-11-17 02:32:20	uupz	want to msg? imma smoke a bowl and ill show you
2017-11-17 02:32:27	uupz	i dont wanna paste here
2017-11-17 02:32:38	rabbitear	so your saying it was leaking the ip?
2017-11-17 02:32:45	uupz	yes my internal
2017-11-17 02:32:50	uupz	even though i used proxychains
2017-11-17 02:33:06	uupz	the pc i was scanning from was 192.168.0.100
2017-11-17 02:33:09	rabbitear	thats weird because that internal is not an ip address 
2017-11-17 02:33:12	uupz	i was scanning to 192.168.0.10
2017-11-17 02:33:26	rabbitear	i dont see how it could show that 
2017-11-17 02:33:35	uupz	they were on the same network
2017-11-17 02:33:39	rabbitear	it should have shown the ip address you were using to connect with
2017-11-17 02:33:44	uupz	yeah
2017-11-17 02:33:46	uupz	that's weird
2017-11-17 02:33:47	rabbitear	yes so it did not leave the network thats why

2017-11-17 02:34:09	uupz	and i know proxychains worked cuz like i said i used dnsleak.com and ipchicken
2017-11-17 02:34:14	uupz	and it masked and said no leaks
2017-11-17 02:34:18	uupz	it leaked to san jose cali
2017-11-17 02:34:18	rabbitear	yes
2017-11-17 02:34:20	uupz	which im no where near
2017-11-17 02:34:31	uupz	THEN i used proxychains nmap blah blah 192.168.0.10
2017-11-17 02:34:37	uupz	and it was not showing any proxychains ip
2017-11-17 02:34:42	rabbitear	something is weird about that because your connection did not hit the intnernet at all

2017-11-17 02:35:38	rabbitear	and see if you see the ip
2017-11-17 02:36:10	uupz	so use my external ip

2017-11-18 14:48:17	As4xk	Should I do anything about DNS settings on my exit relay? I see that the VPS is setup to use 8.8.8.8 as first nameserver and 83.143.80.30 (belongs to the hosting provider) as second nameserver.
2017-11-18 14:51:19	Parckwart	As4xk: it's of course a nice thing if google doesn't see all those requests
2017-11-18 14:52:07	Parckwart	As4xk: perhaps at least reverse that order?
2017-11-18 14:52:24	As4xk	My thought as well. Should I just use the hosting providers nameserver? Should I host my own? Do that help? In the end it needs to ask some other upstream server anyway
2017-11-18 14:53:11	Parckwart	you could of course host your own one if you want to, but that probably won't give you much additional privacy
2017-11-18 14:53:22	Parckwart	your provider can see those requests anyway
2017-11-18 14:53:36	Parckwart	but taking google out of the equation is probably a good thing
2017-11-18 14:54:51	Peng_	It's debatable!
2017-11-18 14:54:59	As4xk	Ok. Thanks :)
2017-11-18 14:55:18	Peng_	Anyone interested in trying 9.9.9.9? https://www.quad9.net
2017-11-18 14:55:27	As4xk	What is debatable? If use google is bad? Or if hosting my own increases privacy?
2017-11-18 14:55:45	Devices	your hosting provider's DNS should be faster too right? Since it's closer
2017-11-18 14:56:13	Peng_	Maybe. A data center in a major city is like 0.2 ms from Google
2017-11-18 14:56:16	Peng_	likely*
2017-11-18 14:56:18	gman999	i would advise against using the goog or someone you dont know who offers their DNS on irc :)
2017-11-18 14:56:24	Peng_	Hah
2017-11-18 14:56:47	Peng_	If you use Google, Google sees all your queries, as does anyone tapping your line to Google. If you use your own recursive DNS server, you spew a lot of DNS queries all over the Internet.
2017-11-18 14:57:24	gman999	yes
2017-11-18 14:57:26	Peng_	(Note: 9.9.9.9 blocks malware. They have other IPs that don't.)
2017-11-18 14:57:50	Parckwart	Peng_: it wouldn't necessarily call that a feature
2017-11-18 15:01:35	As4xk	Will hosting my own prevent DNS censoring? Or will it just ask my ISP's dns server anyway? Can I configure my dns server to go "straight to the source" for correct dns information?
2017-11-18 15:01:47	As4xk	Most ISP's in Norway are forced to block DNS requests for thepiratebay.org for example (not sure if commercial hosting providers are required to do this)

2017-11-18 15:03:29	Parckwart	As4xk: no, you can set it up it to directly ask the nameserver corresponding to the domain
2017-11-18 15:03:44	Parckwart	it's still censorable, but a little harder to do
2017-11-18 15:04:40	As4xk	What are you answering no to? :p I asked 3 questions. No, it will not ask ISP's dns server?
2017-11-18 15:05:02	As4xk	In that case, I think I will go for hosting my own, and using ISP's nameserver as secondary
2017-11-18 15:05:52	Parckwart	no, it won't ask your isp's dns server anyway, if you set it up the right way
2017-11-18 15:06:00	Parckwart	that's the no
