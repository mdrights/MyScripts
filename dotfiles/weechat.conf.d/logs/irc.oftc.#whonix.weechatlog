2017-11-14 05:32:02	dnull	There's a backend qube (usually vault), and the client can be any other Qube
2017-11-14 05:32:08	dnull	Including anon-whonix
2017-11-14 05:33:25	Idkwhoiamyet	I see......
2017-11-14 05:33:28	Idkwhoiamyet	hmm
2017-11-14 05:34:05	dnull	Or you can just run it straight in anon-whonix
2017-11-14 05:34:19	dnull	But split-gpg is more secure, that's why it's suggested
2017-11-14 05:34:35	Idkwhoiamyet	but thats connected to dom0
2017-11-14 05:34:40	Idkwhoiamyet	?
2017-11-14 05:35:04	dnull	No
2017-11-14 05:35:20	dnull	That's why a Qube like vault is used for the backend

2017-11-15 03:44:41	absol	hi
2017-11-15 03:44:55	absol	so according to my konsole everything is up to date
2017-11-15 03:45:06	absol	as far as my sudo apt-get update and upgrade
2017-11-15 03:45:17	absol	but whonix check is giving me this error
2017-11-15 03:45:30	absol	ERROR: Check Timezone Result: 
2017-11-15 03:45:30	absol	timezone_file_expected_content: Etc/UTC 
2017-11-15 03:45:30	absol	timezone_file_actual_content: 
2017-11-15 03:45:30	absol	ERROR: Check Timezone Result: 
2017-11-15 03:45:31	absol	Settings different from Whonix defaults. (See above!) 
2017-11-15 03:45:32	absol	You could try to fix this. 
2017-11-15 03:45:34	absol	Start Menu -> Applications -> System -> Konsole
2017-11-15 03:45:37	absol	sudo su 
2017-11-15 03:45:38	absol	echo "Etc/UTC" > /etc/timezone 
2017-11-15 03:45:41	absol	cp "/usr/share/zoneinfo/Etc/UTC" "/etc/localtime"
2017-11-15 03:45:43	absol	It is generally recommended to keep the default as per Whonix Design. [1] If you did not change timezone related settings, please report this Whonix bug. 
2017-11-15 03:45:46	absol	If you know what you are doing, feel free to disable this check. Create a file /etc/whonix.d/50_whonixcheck_user.conf and add: 
2017-11-15 03:45:49	absol	whonixcheck_skip_functions+=" check_timezone "
2017-11-15 03:46:03	absol	the problem is, i don't understand the command they are trying to tell me to enter the konsole
2017-11-15 03:46:15	absol	so i changed the timezone in the settings and still get this problem
2017-11-15 03:46:29	absol	and i believe this problem is keeping from the tor browser installing properly
2017-11-15 04:20:21	absol	is there a command line listing somewhere for whonix?

2017-11-15 21:09:34	Guest595	Possible reasons:
2017-11-15 21:09:34	Guest595	- The download server is down.
