2017-11-15 22:32:33	stun	email is one of the least secure communications ever
2017-11-15 22:33:08	shieet	not talking about plain email
2017-11-15 22:33:16	shieet	just with gpg
2017-11-15 22:33:20	shieet	and that has limits

2017-11-15 22:33:48	stun	unless u use ridiculous passwords gpg is also not safe
2017-11-15 22:34:17	shieet	not talking about that
2017-11-15 22:34:28	stun	email also has too much metadata
2017-11-15 22:34:40	shieet	but rather metadata and getting the right key of that person
2017-11-15 22:36:17	anonyme22	shieet: even worse than facebook or any social media?
2017-11-15 22:36:42	stun	if the government allows you to use it, you can bet it's because they allow it to happen for a reason.
2017-11-15 22:37:02	stun	if they were threatened by encryption, there would be all sorts of restrictions on its use.
2017-11-15 22:37:10	anonyme22	I know how to remove the metadata, you can remove/edit/do whatever you want with it in some clients such as mutt
2017-11-15 22:37:50	shieet	anonyme22: with gpg ?
2017-11-15 22:37:54	shieet	not worse
2017-11-15 22:38:19	anonyme22	no, I meant the email metadata
2017-11-15 22:38:22	shieet	stun: but you can't really restrict math
2017-11-15 22:39:12	shieet	anonyme22: Facebook can see everything
2017-11-15 22:39:13	stun	thats like saying you can't restrict letters of the alphabet
2017-11-15 22:39:25	stun	or you can't restrict a series of 1's and 0's
2017-11-15 22:39:33	shieet	stun: you actually can't
2017-11-15 22:39:47	shieet	you cannot restrict someone else from learning the alphabet
2017-11-15 22:39:48	stun	actually they can
2017-11-15 22:39:59	stun	prime example: child pr0n.
2017-11-15 22:40:25	shieet	that is illegal ?

2017-11-15 22:41:03	shieet	its not restricted
2017-11-15 22:41:05	shieet	its illegal
2017-11-15 22:41:27	anonyme22	I think you cannot restrict someone else from driving under the influence or driving without permission even street racing...
2017-11-15 22:41:50	stun	its restricted. the government uses it as bait to nab whoever they want.
2017-11-15 22:41:53	shieet	anonyme22: you can't, it's just a felony but that person is not restricted
2017-11-15 22:42:28	anonyme22	no one is restricted
2017-11-15 22:42:44	stun	if encryption was a threat the government would be trying harder to stop it
2017-11-15 22:42:58	shieet	stun: they already try
2017-11-15 22:43:03	shieet	they just can't ban math
2017-11-15 22:43:11	stun	here's a thought, does the highest level of military use GPG for their top secret stuff?
2017-11-15 22:44:02	anonyme22	I'd like to ask you all...
2017-11-15 22:44:26	stun	they can ban certain forms of speech
2017-11-15 22:44:29	stun	such as racism, etc.
2017-11-15 22:44:41	stun	they can sure as hell ban a form of speech called encryption
2017-11-15 22:44:52	stun	or "Code words"
2017-11-15 22:45:30	shieet	stun: they can't
2017-11-15 22:45:44	anonyme22	I want to give temporary my car for my 16 years old friend. The girl would like to learn how to drive myself. What do you all think of it?
2017-11-15 22:45:45	shieet	even in countries were racism is illegal or banned it still happens
2017-11-15 22:46:03	stun	because they are not threatened by it.
2017-11-15 22:46:09	stun	but if they are threatened, they would enforce it.
