2017-11-08 11:05:06	Jeremy_Rand	SHA256 should be db19dfcc23b750c799152d3ed8ff91bf67d8c64ea98992c4fe7940c75daa3514
2017-11-08 11:05:11	asn	can i get source plz?
2017-11-08 11:05:21	Jeremy_Rand	yep, one moment...
2017-11-08 11:05:22	asn	sorry bout that
2017-11-08 11:06:21	Jeremy_Rand	asn: source code links and build instructions are at https://www.namecoin.org/docs/bitcoinj-name-lookups/ , you want the instructions for the bleeding-edge branch
2017-11-08 11:07:00	Jeremy_Rand	(technically that branch isn't really bleeding-edge anymore, I probably should update those instructions to clarify that)
2017-11-08 11:08:13	Jeremy_Rand	The build isn't reproducible right now and the build scripts download some stuff from Maven and Gradle repos, I know that's horrifying and that's on my to-do list to fix
2017-11-08 11:09:02	asn	damn
2017-11-08 11:09:17	asn	let me do some risk assessment

2017-11-08 11:09:51	Jeremy_Rand	asn: yeah, you might want to run it in an untrusted VM or something.
2017-11-08 11:10:19	Jeremy_Rand	(I fully agree that the situation is not great in that respect, and I do intend to get that fixed)

2017-11-08 11:12:12	Jeremy_Rand	honestly the Java ecosystem in general is horrible in that particular area, I'm probably going to have to write a bunch of new RBM descriptors to get the build process sane, since I can't find anyone who's done reproducible Java builds before
2017-11-08 11:12:44	asn	maven and gradle look so sketch  
2017-11-08 11:12:53	asn	i need to get a vm for this
2017-11-08 11:13:09	asn	i think i will work on this first Jeremy_Rand 
2017-11-08 11:13:19	asn	let me setup a virtualbox
2017-11-08 11:13:48	Jeremy_Rand	asn: yes, I agree.  I don't know why people use Maven and Gradle for stuff... the code I'm using is forked from upstream projects that used Maven and Gradle.  Those projects are willing to accept PR's to fix the situation, which I guess is something.
2017-11-08 11:14:01	asn	ok im downloading latest ubuntu iso and virtualbox

2017-11-10 07:47:46	arma2	and micah
2017-11-10 07:48:09	arma2	and kathy
2017-11-10 07:48:44	arma2	and dcf
2017-11-10 07:51:00	arma2	and mikeperry
2017-11-10 07:51:03	+weasel	(Is this one of those "we mailed all the employees and contractors" thing again?)
2017-11-10 07:51:28	arma2	sounds unlikely, given the people i'm finding
2017-11-10 07:51:42	+weasel	yup
2017-11-10 07:51:46	arma2	50/50 paid/unpaid
2017-11-10 07:52:30	+weasel	it seems our svn did not cover the early days of tor
2017-11-10 07:52:37	arma2	and fabio and amogh
2017-11-10 07:52:52	+weasel	when we had router descriptors in the source
2017-11-10 07:53:26	arma2	no, i've found descriptors in the source
2017-11-10 07:55:40	+weasel	+router tor26 62.116.124.106 9001 9050 9030
2017-11-10 07:55:42	+weasel	Date:   Thu May 6 22:46:42 2004 +0000
2017-11-10 07:55:43	+weasel	there
2017-11-10 07:55:52	+weasel	ewin
2017-11-10 07:56:06	+weasel	anyway, coffee :)
2017-11-10 07:56:09	arma2	looks like the same date as the change to "directory server"
2017-11-10 07:56:33	+weasel	    forward-port dirservers file
2017-11-10 07:56:36	+weasel	was the commit message
2017-11-10 07:56:49	+weasel	so who know
2017-11-10 07:56:50	+weasel	s
2017-11-10 07:57:06	arma2	git show 95262111
2017-11-10 07:57:26	arma2	i've always wondered if we ever reused any of those private keys :)
2017-11-10 07:57:54	+weasel	https://xkcd.com/1553/
2017-11-10 08:00:34	arma2	maybe we should leave mikeperry off the people page, so next time somebody notices they're left out, we can use him again to say "see, look, it must have been an accident"

2017-11-10 08:01:32	arma2	and no, it couldn't have been a "we mailed all the" thing,
2017-11-10 08:01:41	arma2	since it was instead a "damian just decided to do it, because nobody else was" thing

2017-11-11 03:16:24	+isabela	arma2: yes, that was actually a question we were having in the global south discussion
2017-11-11 03:16:46	arma2	which that
2017-11-11 03:16:57	+isabela	arma2: if we are successful and folks on these countries starts organizing themselves what infra should they use? a ml per country?
2017-11-11 03:17:12	+isabela	i asked ppl to ask you :P
2017-11-11 03:17:17	arma2	a fine question. per country, per state, per city
2017-11-11 03:17:23	+isabela	per language
2017-11-11 03:17:31	arma2	maybe we get them all to self-organize on google groups ;)
2017-11-11 03:17:45	+isabela	facebook page
2017-11-11 03:18:01	arma2	careful bluffing on that one
2017-11-11 03:18:07	arma2	not everybody will realize it's a bluff
2017-11-11 03:18:10	+isabela	hehehe
2017-11-11 03:18:20	+isabela	ok ok
2017-11-11 03:18:51	arma2	...unless it *isn't* a bluff? :)
2017-11-11 03:19:01	arma2	i mean, let them use the technology they're comfortable with
2017-11-11 03:19:07	+isabela	i think starting per country makes sense in some areas where there arent any group yet organized.. then as they start to get organized in more than one city per country, they start to migrate to their cities
2017-11-11 03:19:33	+isabela	but what if they ask for a ml with tpo domain
2017-11-11 03:19:38	arma2	mailing lists are indeed poor coordination strategies
2017-11-11 03:20:06	+isabela	yeah, this 'scaling' question will be something we will have to figure out
2017-11-11 03:20:13	arma2	i am not sure. we could set up some mailing lists for tpo.
2017-11-11 03:20:19	arma2	the mailman people won't like creating 10 new ones each day
2017-11-11 03:20:29	arma2	also, do we really want to have mailing lists that we aren't on / don't monitor
2017-11-11 03:21:17	arma2	in general, just like for other mailing list situations, "don't fork too soon" is an important rule
2017-11-11 03:21:27	+isabela	yes
2017-11-11 03:21:29	arma2	it is easy to lose momentum by making a subsubsublist sooner than you should
2017-11-11 03:21:32	+isabela	yes
2017-11-11 03:21:40	+isabela	i agree with that 100%
2017-11-11 03:22:22	+isabela	that is why i think folks should all stay at global south list for now and create a  mass of ppl there first
2017-11-11 03:22:23	arma2	find out what social media most of them use, and figure out if there's a way to make that work
2017-11-11 03:22:34	arma2	since mailing lists really do suck for most purposes
2017-11-11 03:22:58	+isabela	i was at this meeting where ppl only use phone numbers no email or social media :)
2017-11-11 03:22:58	arma2	like, maybe we want a database with tags for each person
2017-11-11 03:23:23	arma2	ok mailing lists are better than phones
2017-11-11 03:23:26	+isabela	hehehe
2017-11-11 03:25:16	arma2	but something where people can reach the right granularity seems like it would sure be helpful
2017-11-11 03:25:25	arma2	like, some posts are for the local area, and some are wider
2017-11-11 03:25:37	arma2	we can't be the first humans to encounter this situation
2017-11-11 03:25:52	+isabela	nope
2017-11-11 03:25:56	+isabela	i have seen this grow with ml
2017-11-11 03:25:57	+isabela	or forums
2017-11-11 03:26:07	+isabela	(and today phone numbers! hehe)
2017-11-11 03:26:28	+isabela	or a combination of both, ml and some open forum

2017-11-11 08:04:45	xor-freenet	arma2: in case you're interested - we're on freenode IRC at #freenet, there's ~ 100 people there.
2017-11-11 08:05:31	ryonaloli	freenet is actually pretty good
2017-11-11 08:05:48	ryonaloli	not quite as anonymous as tor, but for a distributed censorship-resistant datastore, it's nice
2017-11-11 08:07:25	xor-freenet	:)   yes i like tor and it has its purpose but freenet does address problems which tor cannot solve. if you want an onion site gone you DoS it and it is gone. if you try to "DoS" content on freenet by requesting it alot of times then you will actually cause it to spread and become MORE accessible.... or in other words: tor only protects the users by making them anonymous. content itself isn't protected, andcannot be, since tor isn't a 
2017-11-11 08:07:26	xor-freenet	storage network.
2017-11-11 08:08:20	ryonaloli	it does protect it from permanent takedown though (or tries to), by making it easier for site owners to just move or to create a new site if necessary.
2017-11-11 08:08:22	xor-freenet	ideally both tor and freenet would be served together, e.g. on the tails live cd.... i suppose given that we'll likely get debian packages within the  next ~ year  that could actually be done :) 
2017-11-11 08:08:40	ryonaloli	well unfortunately freenet needs quite some time to get up to speed, and tails is amnesic and has to remain on for short periods
2017-11-11 08:08:54	xor-freenet	ryonaloli: mmh yeah you're right, but well it doesn't matter if a site is still online if nobody knows its address :|
2017-11-11 08:09:11	ryonaloli	true
2017-11-11 08:09:44	xor-freenet	t0mmy: ^^^ CC the last few lines.
2017-11-11 08:09:53	ryonaloli	i just wish freenet took security itself as seriously (seccomp, etc)
2017-11-11 08:09:56	ryonaloli	cuz java is ew

2017-11-11 08:11:03	xor-freenet	ryonaloli: @ time to get up to speed: bootstrapping should be a lot better nowadays.
2017-11-11 08:11:30	ryonaloli	what about the issue of the seed nodes or w/e those equivalents of guard nodes are? i mean restarting often would increase the risk of sybil
2017-11-11 08:11:42	ryonaloli	or at least not make it possible to stick with a single seed node for long periods to avoid that
2017-11-11 08:11:47	xor-freenet	ryonaloli: @ short uptime of tails: data is always stored on multiple machines on freenet, it doesn't hurt that much if there are some tails users as long as it isn't a majority.
2017-11-11 08:12:06	ryonaloli	ah
2017-11-11 08:12:15	ryonaloli	perhaps if someone set up a high-capacity freenet onion portal
2017-11-11 08:12:22	ryonaloli	then it'd be easier to do it on tails
2017-11-11 08:12:39	ryonaloli	i'd do that but i wouldn't want to pay out of my own pocket cuz the bandwidth and space costs would be insane
2017-11-11 08:12:49	xor-freenet	ryonaloli: @ security:  heh part of why we're using java is actually because it's *more* secure than e.g. C. you can't just write bugs which contain remote code exploitability on java as it is a VM-based language.
2017-11-11 08:13:14	ryonaloli	in theory yeah, but there are better memory safe languages than java
2017-11-11 08:13:20	xor-freenet	ryonaloli: with regards to any other security issue the usual applies: file a bug :)   (at https://bugs.freenetproject.org)

2017-11-11 08:13:52	ryonaloli	would a patch to support seccomp get accepted? (assuming the jvm isn't so insane that syscall filtering is neigh impossible)
2017-11-11 08:14:59	xor-freenet	ryonaloli: @ seed nodes: that's also something that is IMHO better address in freenet than tor (yet?): we encourage users to add real persons as "friends" / "darknet peers" to set up a permanent connection to them which can be used for obtaining other peers, i.e. strangers, while avoiding sybil.
2017-11-11 08:15:28	ryonaloli	sure but that's risky for people who's threat model negates that, or for people without close friends
2017-11-11 08:15:37	ryonaloli	(tor has bridges though which serve a similar purpose)
2017-11-11 08:15:57	xor-freenet	ryonaloli: @ onion portal: that'd void a lot of usability (performance) and security, but yea, why not. there are gateways on the regular internet, freenet has a gateway mode
2017-11-11 08:16:25	xor-freenet	ryonaloli: @ "better languages": well rewriting a project of 350 000 lines of code is a decade of work, are you gonna do that? :)
2017-11-11 08:16:32	ryonaloli	i wish :P
2017-11-11 08:16:45	ryonaloli	just wish it were something else to begin with. like even tor in C is pretty well audited
2017-11-11 08:17:02	ryonaloli	very little issue with bugs in the C runtime
2017-11-11 08:17:03	xor-freenet	ryonaloli: java has improved A LOT over the years anyway. e.g. lambda expressions of java 8 eliminate a lot of the "noisyness". and fancy new languages like kotlin actually use the java VM.
2017-11-11 08:17:28	ryonaloli	i guess i'm just bitter cuz i prefer things a bit lower level so i know what's going on
2017-11-11 08:17:48	xor-freenet	ryonaloli: @ seccomp patch: if it doesn't break anything, sure, why not? :)
2017-11-11 08:18:08	ryonaloli	as long as the jvm supports it without changing which syscalls it uses too much
2017-11-11 08:18:47	xor-freenet	ryonaloli: @ "sure but that's risky for people who's threat model negates that, or for people without close friends"    it isn't any less secure than connecting to strangers. you don't expose your traffic to a single peer. your traffic is randomly spread across all of them. you don't need peers to be trustworthy, they only need to be *distinct* human beings, i.e. not sybils. 
2017-11-11 08:19:20	ryonaloli	then why not do it like tor does and just stick with a single or few entrances for a long time?
2017-11-11 08:19:24	ryonaloli	at least by default
2017-11-11 08:19:31	xor-freenet	ryonaloli: frankly i thing the whole "java sucks" thing is just a meme. i've worked with it for 10 years now and i like it a lot. it's an easy, patient, well-predictable language.
2017-11-11 08:19:54	xor-freenet	ryonaloli: it has been repeated so much over the internet that "java sucks" that people just keep repeating it without even knowing why it would
2017-11-11 08:20:18	ryonaloli	personally i don't like it because it's not low enough level, and because it looks aesthetically ugly
2017-11-11 08:21:08	xor-freenet	ryonaloli: @ " then why not do it like tor does and just stick with a single or few entrances for a long time?"  because you cannot know that they're not maliciously causing all your other peers to actually be sybils.
2017-11-11 08:21:33	ryonaloli	right but it's better to stick with one than to try many of them rapidly
2017-11-11 08:21:41	xor-freenet	ryonaloli: really the only thing which prevents sybil are one of the two:  1) ensuring your peers are real humans   2) requiring a scarce resource = either captchas or bitcoin.
2017-11-11 08:22:02	ryonaloli	real humans could still be performing sybils though
2017-11-11 08:22:21	xor-freenet	ryonaloli: the technical difficulty of humans doing sybil is insanely more high than computers doing it.
2017-11-11 08:22:38	ryonaloli	in the end, i think a computer's doing it regardless :P
2017-11-11 08:22:48	ryonaloli	i haven't yet found a way to get the jvm to run in my brain
2017-11-11 08:22:52	xor-freenet	ryonaloli: @ uglyness: i'd really thoroughly recommend reading about java 8's lambda expressions :)
2017-11-11 08:23:12	ryonaloli	does it get rid of camelcase? :P
2017-11-11 08:23:47	xor-freenet	you can write your code in whatever case you please.

2017-11-11 08:25:19	ryonaloli	post-quantum cryptography
2017-11-11 08:25:23	ryonaloli	sidh, ntru, newhope, etc
2017-11-11 08:25:54	xor-freenet	mmh nobody is working on that for freenet that i'm aware of
2017-11-11 08:26:02	ryonaloli	that's too bad
2017-11-11 08:26:13	ryonaloli	what tls lib does freenet use? it might not be difficult to provide that
2017-11-11 08:26:16	xor-freenet	are there working quantum computers yet?
2017-11-11 08:26:20	ryonaloli	e.g. with boringssl or microsoft's sidh patch
2017-11-11 08:26:32	ryonaloli	yeah, though the only cryptoanalytic ones are pretty slow. they're advancing very fast though.
2017-11-11 08:26:45	xor-freenet	freenet doesn't use SSL except if you want to use the web interface with it over the network, but typically you only expose the web interface on localhost.
2017-11-11 08:26:49	ryonaloli	i don't like "the future me can deal with this" mentality, cuz when they are ready, they can retroactively decrypt standard crypto
2017-11-11 08:26:55	ryonaloli	oh, what type of kex does it use then?
2017-11-11 08:27:01	xor-freenet	it uses the bouncycastle crypto library and java's own crypto API.
2017-11-11 08:27:13	ryonaloli	ah
2017-11-11 08:27:23	ryonaloli	no clue if those support pqc or not
2017-11-11 08:27:24	xor-freenet	i think it benchmarks which is faster on the particular machine and uses that.
2017-11-11 08:27:54	xor-freenet	kex = key exchange?
2017-11-11 08:28:01	ryonaloli	yeah
2017-11-11 08:28:29	ryonaloli	cuz if it already uses curve25519, then it might not be too difficult to change to that google-designed newhope-curve25519 hybrid
2017-11-11 08:28:50	xor-freenet	i think it's called JFK, though i am not sure as i don't work on the crypto stuff, i work on apps built on top of freenet.
2017-11-11 08:29:31	ryonaloli	ah
2017-11-11 08:29:37	xor-freenet	it may be this: https://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~angelos/Papers/draft-keromytis-jfk-04.txt
2017-11-11 08:30:32	xor-freenet	though there are several different layers of cryptography in freenet... traffic among peers is encrypted, and uses the JFK stuff; but the data itself is also encrypted, and there are different ways to upload data to freenet (by file hash, or by public key)
2017-11-11 08:30:53	ryonaloli	well the asymmetric crypto is really all that matters for pqc
2017-11-11 08:31:35	xor-freenet	these are things which probably would be more likely to be dealt with if we had more funding than ~ $ 25 000 per year, we largely rely on volunteers for such things.
2017-11-11 08:31:57	ryonaloli	if it were C, it'd be a lot easier to use pqc libraries :/
2017-11-11 08:32:04	ryonaloli	(read: i don't know enough java to implement crypto myself)
2017-11-11 08:32:33	xor-freenet	look i've worked on freenet for almost 10 years, i won't throw all of my code away because of "random stranger's java discussion number 238747912345"   :)
2017-11-11 08:32:47	ryonaloli	fair :P
2017-11-11 08:33:07	xor-freenet	and even if we did that and did chose whatever other language is the fancy thing of the year, then people would also complain about that language after two years.
2017-11-11 08:33:26	ryonaloli	sure, and things like rust don't even have a formal spec, so yeah
2017-11-11 08:34:38	xor-freenet	part of being an engineer is accepting that you have to do things in the scientifically correct way to get things done, and that means that if hundreds of people have been working on something in language X for 16 years then you have to use language X, there is no choice :)
2017-11-11 08:35:00	ryonaloli	true. i just don't know it well enough to submit a patch.
2017-11-11 08:35:10	ryonaloli	that's why i like c in foss, cuz it's not hard to get familiar with new cocde
2017-11-11 08:35:42	xor-freenet	well that's the nice thing about java, it's so damn easy you can learn it in a few days if you know C :)
2017-11-11 08:36:03	ryonaloli	is there any way to plug C libraries into java without porting them entirely? some kind of plugin system?
2017-11-11 08:36:55	xor-freenet	there is an API to freenet which can be accessed by TCP/IP, it's called "FCP", freenet client protocol. so you can use *any* language. there are libraries in "cool" stuff like python.
2017-11-11 08:37:23	ryonaloli	but could it plug into something as core to freenet as the key exchange used?

2017-11-12 06:32:48	popup	my comment on the blog has not been approved yet (been days?) for the file:/// vuln. someone asked what it could be, and i provided some speculation. for what reason was it censored?
2017-11-12 06:48:31	arma2	probably because it's saturday night and whoever might approve the blog comments has taken a few days off
2017-11-12 06:50:48	popup	ah, haven't had it take this long before. that makes sense though.
2017-11-12 06:50:59	arma2	friday was apparently a US holiday
2017-11-12 07:00:45	arma2	yep, 29 unapproved comments
2017-11-12 07:01:17	popup	i posted mine twice since i thought i didn't end up posting it, before i realized that it was unapproved.
2017-11-12 07:01:19	arma2	i am sad that the newer blog is uglier, but i am super happy that we stumbled across a brilliant anti-blog-spam technique
2017-11-12 07:01:54	popup	what is the technique, manual approval? and i don't like the new blog much. ugly, and it's broken unless you enable js.
2017-11-12 07:02:07	arma2	(that "preview comment" button is kind of obnoxious, but it makes all of the auto spammers think that they finished their comment)
2017-11-12 07:03:09	popup	ah makes sense. using dummy fields is also useful (i do that on my site and it works fine), returning a 200 response to make the bots think it was successful, and adding the ip to the blacklist when they submit with the hidden dummy fields.
2017-11-12 07:03:45	arma2	you might imagine that we're not huge fans of ip based blacklists :)

2017-11-14 05:13:03	+Phoul	tjr: I haven't seen anything block Tor in a while outside of Trusteer, usually we document this on Trac though if its something that multiple users run into / if its not quickly resolved. 
2017-11-14 05:13:37	+Phoul	In the trusteer case, there was no resolution, I still get emails from them every couple weeks saying they are looking into it. However, users have stopped reporting it. Not sure if this means its fixed, or if all the trusteer users gave up.
2017-11-14 05:13:46	+Phoul	I wasnt able to reproduce the issue at any point.
2017-11-14 05:15:19	+Phoul	tjr: flexlibris and I are also working on a blog post for running relays, I think it should be done soon. There is also an "operators" section in the support portal, which currently lives at https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/teams/CommunityTeam/Support#Operator
2017-11-14 05:15:41	+Phoul	The support portal will be moving off Trac soonish.

2017-11-14 05:45:11	arma2	tjr: you can also look in the tor browser blog posts
2017-11-14 05:45:20	arma2	hunt for where we point people to https://www.torproject.org/docs/faq#VirusFalsePositives
2017-11-14 05:45:51	arma2	phoul: so, re moving support to just email, i was wondering if we should try to figure out what are the best practices for our peer groups
2017-11-14 05:46:08	arma2	like, i can totally see the appeal of moving support to just email
2017-11-14 05:47:19	arma2	but i also wonder if we will later regret the choice to smear it over a bunch of individual mail boxes
2017-11-14 05:48:14	arma2	it's useful to point out that we're doing that right now by having rt do that for us
2017-11-14 05:48:22	arma2	and maybe we should fix that rather than embrace it
2017-11-14 05:48:30	arma2	but also maybe rt is a terrible interface for actually getting work done
2017-11-14 05:50:52	arma2	so, high order bit, let's think of other groups we admire who try to do support, and find out what they do
2017-11-14 05:50:57	+Phoul	Very true. With RT we could fix that by disabling notifications. However that also has its own issues. Currently the people working on frontdesk@ have indicated they are not fond of using RT as it requires multiple steps to send responses. 
2017-11-14 05:51:20	+Phoul	The group I thought of first was Tails, and they do theirs via a mailing list, iirc. 
2017-11-14 05:52:13	+Phoul	Looking into other groups would be a good idea though. Most of the ones im aware of use mailing lists (guardian does as well, I think).
2017-11-14 05:52:24	arma2	who were the earlier support folks who advocated for a retention (or rather, lack of retention) policy? was that lunar and moritz?
2017-11-14 05:52:55	+Phoul	It was Lunar. He wrote our current scripts for cleaning RT.
2017-11-14 05:53:46	+Phoul	Unless there was another round of this before the paid support team, then it may have been moritz
2017-11-14 05:54:13	arma2	i remember that moritz had opinions too. i might remember incorrectly. :)

2017-11-14 05:55:08	arma2	i mean, in terms of what actually works, we should ask the people who will be doing the work
2017-11-14 05:55:21	arma2	but in terms of safety, we should ask all sorts of people for advice
2017-11-14 05:55:56	arma2	doesn't tails have a shared key for at least some of their addresses?

2017-11-14 06:01:02	+Phoul	Looks like they do offer a key on their contact page. The old help-desk had discussed having a shared key, however it was decided against. Maybe thats something we should reconsider, if we go this way. 
2017-11-14 06:10:55	arma2	it's probably hell for usability too

2017-11-14 06:12:42	arma2	i guess we should remember that our goal here is to *not* end up doing support this way at all
2017-11-14 06:12:44	--	infinity0 is now known as Guest503
2017-11-14 06:12:45	--	infinity0_ is now known as infinity0
2017-11-14 06:13:11	+Phoul	Agreed, however frontdesk@ is no longer just support. I imagine the address will outlive the support side, unless a new contact address is given.
2017-11-14 06:13:18	arma2	yep
2017-11-14 06:16:00	arma2	so, suggested way forward: think of some peer projects and find out what they do,
2017-11-14 06:16:11	arma2	think of some people inside tor who would have good advice, and ask them for it
2017-11-14 06:16:22	arma2	i feel weird being the one to make decisions like this, in a vacuum

2017-11-14 06:16:57	arma2	i would feel better if there is a group of us who have thought things through and decided it's a good plan
2017-11-14 06:17:23	arma2	i guess 'you me alison' is a good start at a group, but does it represent enough interests?
2017-11-14 06:17:50	+Phoul	currently the group is everyone on frontdesk@ plus you, however I think asking more people would likely be good.
2017-11-14 06:18:22	+Phoul	so you, me, alison, tommy, steph and Jon
2017-11-14 06:24:53	+gamambel	the good thing about RT is that mails can be claimed and then disappear from the queue, which is not the case with a simple mailing list or shared IMAP
2017-11-14 06:25:14	+gamambel	shared IMAP requires a lot of discipline and initial coordination, flags, folders
2017-11-14 06:26:23	+gamambel	at least back when i did the support, it was a quite substantial number of mails, which i am not sure will work for everyone, especially if they also have to check the replies and see if a thread is finished
2017-11-14 06:26:25	arma2	phoul: how would 'just an email alias' work? everybody takes a different hour? everybody agrees to be fine with multiple replies sometimes?
2017-11-14 06:27:38	+gamambel	and: you can't hide, i have a highlight on moritz as well ;)

2017-11-14 06:40:16	+Phoul	arma2: We would have to come up with some type of system. This was another thing I mentioned to the group, however I think it could be worked out in a way that we were not stepping on each other. Losing the ticketing features is a big draw back though, however if its between getting 2 responses in a reasonable amount of time or no response for longer, 2 responses would be better I think. 
2017-11-14 06:40:22	+Phoul	People seem to really dislike using RT.
2017-11-14 06:41:29	arma2	i don't blame them
2017-11-14 06:41:43	+gamambel	i am not sure if people would answer more mail if it was a flood to their inbox... in any case it has to become a part of the daily routine. i actually liked how it is a separate world from my all-email-mail-client
2017-11-14 06:41:45	arma2	i guess "figure out what other people do" needs to have a component of "and does it actually work for them"
2017-11-14 06:42:35	arma2	since yeah, rt bad, but 'we would have to come up with some type of system' says to me that there is some more thinking to do :)
2017-11-14 06:43:48	arma2	one answer is to have a narrower funnel at the beginning
2017-11-14 06:44:06	arma2	like, one or two people who are the frontdesk, and sort incoming things
2017-11-14 06:47:20	+Phoul	gamambel: I'm not sure if they would or not. The main isssue people have is with the interface, which email would fix (if they like their email interface). I think figuring out what other peopl edo and what works and doesnt is a good next step though.

2017-11-15 16:33:20	irl	Sebastian: i think it's a good idea
2017-11-15 16:33:55	irl	Sebastian: the problem is that we would want metrics.tpo and atlas.tpo to be in sync, otherwise you end up fetching everything twice and breaking the seamless integration (waiting while you fetch all the resources you already have)
2017-11-15 16:34:28	+Sebastian	that seems like a one-time cost that could easily be paid during a transition phase?
2017-11-15 16:34:59	+Sebastian	going from metrics to atlas loads a bunch of extra javascript anyway
2017-11-15 16:35:23	irl	yes, but it shouldn't reload the metrics css and images, and a bunch of the javascript is actually metrics.tpo js
2017-11-15 16:35:42	irl	i think the patch is good, but it's too much, it should be restricted to only things that are atlas specific
2017-11-15 16:35:55	irl	which means it needs me to look at it
2017-11-15 16:36:20	irl	Sebastian: i will make coffee and look at it now

2017-11-15 17:59:31	boklm	yes, this does not solve the problem
2017-11-15 18:00:32	+weasel	if you want to keep the service as is, I suggest we move to a VM on kvm4.

2017-11-15 18:02:57	+weasel	nothing specific
2017-11-15 18:03:18	+nickm	Is it possible (and , if possible, easier) to add more HD to this VM?
2017-11-15 18:03:35	+weasel	listera is metal.
2017-11-15 18:03:56	+nickm	Ah.
2017-11-15 18:04:02	+weasel	it's a piece of metal we inherited from debian
2017-11-15 18:04:06	+weasel	it used to run lists.debian.org
2017-11-15 18:04:29	+nickm	The only other decent alternative would seem to be _not_ hanging onto old TB releases forever.  But that's scary.
2017-11-15 18:04:44	+nickm	(similarly old debs, old fedoras, old everything)
2017-11-15 18:05:40	+nickm	GeKo, mikeperry: I bet that sounds like a bad idea to you?
2017-11-15 18:18:57	+GeKo	nickm: if we can avoid that that might be worthwhile
2017-11-15 18:20:28	+weasel	should I do an initial sync of /srv/archive.tpo for you?
2017-11-15 18:20:34	+weasel	or would you like to do that yourselves?
2017-11-15 18:21:23	boklm	I think you can do it
2017-11-15 18:21:25	+nickm	You mean, under the assumption that we'll move everything to a new VM ?
2017-11-15 18:21:33	+nickm	If so, yes please.
2017-11-15 18:21:35	+weasel	is that a bad assumption?
2017-11-15 18:21:42	+nickm	I think it's a good assumption
2017-11-15 18:21:54	+nickm	our other options seem poor.
2017-11-15 18:22:04	+nickm	Please let me know if you'd rather have any of this done by somebody else.
2017-11-15 18:22:18	+weasel	I think the initial rsync is easy enough.
2017-11-15 18:22:28	+weasel	I'll let y'all handle moving scripts and whatnot
2017-11-15 18:22:47	boklm	I can move the scripts to the new host
2017-11-15 18:24:54	+nickm	we'll have to move some cnames around, right?
2017-11-15 18:25:03	+nickm	and disable the scripts on the old host, once the new one is working?
2017-11-15 18:28:29	boklm	I already disabled the scripts on listera, to avoid filling the disk

2017-11-15 19:32:13	+weasel	ah, I thought we had added exonerator to gid exonerator-web.  seems I didn't.
2017-11-15 19:33:04	+weasel	now you should have all you need, I think.
2017-11-15 19:33:09	+weasel	remember, only the owner can chmod/chgrp.
2017-11-15 19:33:21	+karsten	ok. retrying.
2017-11-15 19:33:25	+weasel	(and exonerator may need to re-login)
2017-11-15 19:33:40	+weasel	since you can only chgrp to groups you are a member of, usually)

2017-11-15 19:46:46	+karsten	8000 is the exonerator jetty.
