2017-11-11 00:40:09	MDrights[SW	Hi, I had just installed freedombox on a fresh Debian machine (RPi 3). While Plinth seems okay, Tor couldn't be installed via the button on the Plinth page...
2017-11-11 00:40:21	MDrights[SW	The error info: `Error installing application: Error during installation W: http: aptMethod::Configuration: could not load seccomp policy: Invalid argument E: Failed to fetch http://http.kali.org/kali/pool/main/a/apt-transport-tor/apt-transport-tor_0.3_all.deb Could not resolve 'http.kali.org' E: Failed to fetch http://http.kali.org/kali/pool/main/t/torsocks/torsocks_2.2.0-2_armhf.deb Could

2017-11-11 00:53:54	MDrights[SW	I am wonder if Plinth implement installing Tor via Tor tunnel? (XD
2017-11-11 01:09:16	MDrights[SW	Eh, why is /etc/resolv.conf empty now?
2017-11-11 01:35:56	MDrights[SW	It's weird.. The file  /etc/resolv.conf -> /etc/resolvconf/run/resolv.conf (?
2017-11-11 01:36:16	MDrights[SW	And now the machine could not resolve any domains....
2017-11-11 01:38:47	MDrights[SW	Anybody see my words?....please...
2017-11-11 01:39:44	mray[m]1	did you let freedombox upgrade properly?
2017-11-11 01:40:30	MDrights[SW	mray[m]1: do you mean `apt upgrade` ?
2017-11-11 01:40:44	MDrights[SW	what do you mean by 'upgrade' ?
2017-11-11 01:40:50	mray[m]1	i'm no expert, but maybe you installed before upgrading to the latest FreedomBox version? - maybe this isn't even a possible problem.
2017-11-11 01:41:01	mray[m]1	yes, update and upgrade.
2017-11-11 01:41:20	mray[m]1	just to make sure you are not running into an issue that might already have been fixed.
2017-11-11 01:42:02	mray[m]1	also maybe you lost internet connection during the update?
2017-11-11 01:42:18	mray[m]1	disclaimer: just fishing here, no expert
2017-11-11 01:42:32	MDrights[SW	see. However, the problem is just that I couldn't do any apt update/upgrade at first place :)
2017-11-11 01:43:20	MDrights[SW	before install freedom-setup, apt update and any domain resolution work.
2017-11-11 01:43:56	mray[m]1	hm maybe you triggered the tor installation (that takes a long time and may have messed with routing) and aborted it?
2017-11-11 01:44:40	MDrights[SW	I press the Tor installation button on Plinth, and thus found the problem.
2017-11-11 01:45:18	MDrights[SW	It aborted with error message shown above..
2017-11-11 01:45:50	MDrights[SW	and I later login via ssh into it, finding that apt update indeed doesn't work
2017-11-11 01:46:13	MDrights[SW	due to the resolution un-ability.
2017-11-11 01:46:21	MDrights[SW	disability(
2017-11-11 01:46:56	mray[m]1	what about dkpk-reconfigure? did that work?
2017-11-11 01:48:07	MDrights[SW	have not tried yet.
2017-11-11 01:48:50	MDrights[SW	will try later
2017-11-11 01:48:52	mray[m]1	maybe that finds and fixes some broken packages?
2017-11-11 01:49:01	MDrights[SW	emmm...
2017-11-11 01:50:04	MDrights[SW	Now I am trying to symlink the original resolv file back to /etc/resolv.conf
2017-11-11 01:50:39	MDrights[SW	But being doubt that my manual setting might be overwritten by some apps.
2017-11-11 01:57:20	MDrights[SW	Well, now Tor has been installed. But the problem might still exist. 
2017-11-11 01:58:02	mray[m]1	so you can't upgrade?
2017-11-11 01:58:06	mray[m]1	or update?
2017-11-11 01:59:08	MDrights[SW	The real problem behind update/upgrade problem is the mal-function of domain resolution.
2017-11-11 01:59:42	MDrights[SW	I don't know the mechanism inside FB yet (I am fresh XD)
2017-11-11 02:00:15	MDrights[SW	Why FB set/modify the original domain resolution setting....
2017-11-11 02:00:48	MDrights[SW	It makes complex symlinking in resolvconf ....
2017-11-11 02:01:12	mray[m]1	no idea, really. best advice i can give is to maybe start rebooting? lol
2017-11-11 02:01:45	MDrights[SW	Oh, I am afraid if rebooting makes my manual setting backward...
2017-11-11 02:02:19	mray[m]1	did you do anything special with that particular FreedomBox?
2017-11-11 02:02:49	MDrights[SW	Nope. I just install freedom-setup on a fresh-installed Debian/Kali OS
2017-11-11 02:02:51	mray[m]1	putting th image on the sdcard again usually is easy and fast :/
2017-11-11 02:04:49	MDrights[SW	(go on talking about the resolution issue): I saw there are quite a few symlinks between the resolv files but the final files remain unexisted. This is the cause. 
2017-11-11 02:05:45	MDrights[SW	If sincerely developers of FB see my report, please take a look and see if it can be reproduced...

2017-11-11 06:12:22	MDrights[SW	therefore there are a few obstacles to be tackle. First I need make it and its Tor traffic go through our socks5 proxy to bypass the 'wall'. And this needs some dirty technical work on the commandline :)

2017-11-11 11:38:05	MDrights[SW	Hi, does meek bridge equipped in FreedomBox's Tor ?
2017-11-11 11:52:18	jonas	MDrights[SW: you might have better luck asking some of your questions in various Debian channels - FreedomBox is a Debian Pure Blend, which implies that most parts are *identical* in any other Debian install, and others might be more knowledgeable and/or responsive to questions
2017-11-11 11:59:26	MDrights[SW	jonas: okay. Thx~
2017-11-11 12:01:29	jonas	ah, I notice now that you installed on top of Kali - so you probably new that already - sorry!
2017-11-11 12:04:53	jonas	MDrights[SW: specifically about the many symlinks related to name resolving: are you familiar with resovconf? I guess it is not not unique to FreedomBox what is happening there, but tied to how resolvconf generally works
2017-11-11 12:10:14	MDrights[SW	jonas: oh, I resolved this, at this morning. :P
2017-11-11 12:10:35	jonas	good
2017-11-11 12:11:05	MDrights[SW	but I think this was not a general mistake...since I didn't do anything before installing freedombox on top of Kali...
2017-11-11 12:11:52	MDrights[SW	The resolv.conf was overwritten with vacant content...
2017-11-11 12:12:57	jonas	my point is that maybe it was a problem with resolvconf rather than a problem with freedombox
2017-11-11 12:13:33	jonas	no matter if it was a mistake on your part, a bug in the package, or perhaps a bug in other surrounding packages (possibly specific to Kali)
2017-11-11 12:14:15	MDrights[SW	As for meek, as far as I know, one needs to install meek-client along with Tor, if one wants to connect to a meek bridge..
2017-11-11 12:14:44	jonas	if you try work on the problem from the freedombox end, then you will have less knowledgeable people around you to help nail the cause of the problem, than if working from where most likely the cause is
2017-11-11 12:15:04	MDrights[SW	So I'd suggest if there's an easy way to install meek-client as well from Plinth )
2017-11-11 12:15:26	jonas	I don't know meek, it seems to be something not in Debian - and therefore not in freedombox either
2017-11-11 12:15:37	MDrights[SW	jonas: yes. I fixed the resolv.conf by hand)
2017-11-11 12:15:50	jonas	first step to getting it into Freedombox is to get it packaged officially for Debian
2017-11-11 12:16:03	jonas	s/packaged/packaged and maintained/
2017-11-11 12:16:30	MDrights[SW	yeah, seems not in Debian. But now it is the only available / workable PT to bypass GFW in CHina.
2017-11-11 12:16:42	jonas	I understand that you fixed the resolv.conf issue - but also you wrote that it was not a general mistake
2017-11-11 12:16:45	MDrights[SW	I see.
2017-11-11 12:17:17	jonas	I understand that you need meek for the annoying country-wide firewall
2017-11-11 12:17:25	MDrights[SW	:)
2017-11-11 12:17:45	MDrights[SW	I saw obfs4proxy was installed easily along with Tor
2017-11-11 12:18:05	MDrights[SW	so, just an idea that meek could be installed that way as well )
2017-11-11 12:18:54	jonas	part of what makes installs "easy" is that the (possibly) hard part is done already - that is what "packaged and maintained officially in Debian" implies
2017-11-11 12:19:52	MDrights[SW	ha, I understand that. So...however you have no plan to maintain your own repo, don't you?
2017-11-11 12:19:56	jonas	please see here: https://wiki.debian.org/FreedomBox/Contribute#Contributions_needed
2017-11-11 12:20:30	MDrights[SW	ok
2017-11-11 12:20:34	jonas	Freedombox has no plans to change its current status as a Debian Pure Blend - which means Debian is the repository, no external repository needed!
2017-11-11 12:21:44	jonas	even if you do not want to roll up the sleeves and maintain a package yourself, you can help by formally reporting the code project(s) you would like to see packaged and integrated with FreedomBox
2017-11-11 12:22:41	jonas	formally reported requests are far easier for those busy developing FreedomBox than informal mentions here on irc
2017-11-11 12:22:59	MDrights[SW	well, I see. I therefore can maintain a package myself. just ask (
2017-11-11 12:23:22	jonas	you can maintain packages yourself if you want
2017-11-11 12:23:49	jonas	you can also ask others to maintain packages you want but don't have time/skills to package and maintain
2017-11-11 12:28:59	MDrights[SW	ok, I am reading the page for contribution (
2017-11-11 13:06:28	jonas	great

2017-11-11 13:27:40	painy	is it feasible to install freedombox on beaglebone but with parabola as the distro instead of debian?

2017-11-11 14:09:13	federico3	jonas: it's not even Debian-based
2017-11-11 14:09:18	federico3	are we having the hack call?

2017-11-11 14:10:07	jonas	ah, right - I confused Parabola and Gnewsense

2017-11-12 12:22:04	MDrights[SW	Dear Developers, sorry for asking here and I know I can contribute my skills to Freedombox project. But I have an idea which is if there's a possibiility to add a couple of check-boxes that let Tor client starts with bridges (various types) and/or pre-proxy(socks5) on Plinth page?
2017-11-12 12:22:49	MDrights[SW	see if this idea is appropriate...
2017-11-12 12:32:12	jvalleroy	MDrights[SW: You can see the version number in Help > About.
2017-11-12 12:34:17	jvalleroy	MDrights[SW: The Tor page has an option to "Use upstream bridges to connect to Tor network".  Then you will have to paste in the bridges information.
2017-11-12 12:34:44	jvalleroy	We don't hae a pre-proxy option yet, I would suggest to create an issue for that.
2017-11-12 12:37:56	MDrights[SW	jvalleroy: This sounds great. :)
2017-11-12 12:41:17	MDrights[SW	Since, the most effective method to make Tor available is to use a pre-proxy in China. And I am always putting `Socks5Proxy` parameter in the torrc. :)
2017-11-12 12:41:30	MDrights[SW	jvalleroy: Okay, I see them. Thanks~

2017-11-15 16:15:36	nasd42	-> that leads to questions: since the freedombox is not connected to the internet will it work anyway
2017-11-15 16:16:04	nasd42	should i buy a usb to ethernet adapter for my OLIMEX/Freedombox
2017-11-15 16:16:35	nasd42	put freedombox 1st after the routers ethernet then into the hub

2017-11-15 16:38:52	nasd4	nice: i connected to freedombox on my OLIMEX
2017-11-15 16:41:02	nasd4	i want to know which version is my freedombox now. i only have the ssh in a terminal
2017-11-15 16:42:19	nasd4	Linux freedombox 4.12.0-2-armmp-lpae #1 SMP Debian 4.12.13-1 (2017-09-19)
2017-11-15 16:42:27	nasd4	via uname -a
2017-11-15 16:43:53	nasd4	is this spamming or any good btw? maybe people find this in the logs ?
2017-11-15 16:47:03	nasd4	uname -a gives me the debian version but not plinth
2017-11-15 16:50:06	nasd4	nice via ssh i get the ip etc. , and it is added now as a known host , maybe nmap now :D
2017-11-15 16:53:08	JoKe[m]	Hi nasd4 , you can find the Plinth version at Help > About. Or via ssh with "apt-cache show plinth".
2017-11-15 16:55:38	nasd4	noted. in the manual i find http://the-hostname-you-entered-during-install.local/ <- that doesnt work or should it be hostname-freedombox.local ? i try
2017-11-15 16:56:15	nasd4	i logged out on ssh and try via browser again. could i enter it with browser and terminal ?
2017-11-15 17:02:14	nasd4	plinth seems fine:

2017-11-15 17:11:16	nasd4	well i get the freedombox via ssh, but i dont manage to get to the neat interface via browser
2017-11-15 17:12:42	nasd4	due to ssh i know the ip of the box but it isnt any close to the normal 192.168. ... or 10.42. etc

2017-11-15 17:14:20	JoKe[m]	I think it should be https://freedombox.local/plinth , or try https://IP-ADDRESS/plinth
2017-11-15 17:14:22	nasd4	in the manuel there is Apache running
2017-11-15 17:14:24	JoKe[m]	Where IP-Address is the one you use for SSH
2017-11-15 17:14:47	JoKe[m]	Then you should see a warning about an invalid certificate, for which you have to allow an exception to connect anyways.
2017-11-15 17:15:00	nasd4	i used ssh user@freedombox.local
2017-11-15 17:15:20	nasd4	saw that and entered my pw
2017-11-15 17:16:50	JoKe[m]	So if SSH is working, I don't get why the browser doesn't, except if plinth isn't really running. What does "systemctl status plinth" say?
2017-11-15 17:17:55	JoKe[m]	The IP address seems odd indeed, though. FreedomBox tries to find one with DHCP.

2017-11-15 17:21:56	JoKe[m]	Well it seems to be a public IP address, not a local one. But you said it's a box in your local network?
2017-11-15 17:22:06	nasd4	y
2017-11-15 17:22:12	nasd4	it is
2017-11-15 17:23:04	nasd4	or i misstake it for my kabeldeutschland router

2017-11-15 17:23:13	JoKe[m]	Also it's running since 4 months?
2017-11-15 17:23:45	nasd4	well i installed it in other networks
2017-11-15 17:23:51	JoKe[m]	Maybe your router maps port 443 to your box?
2017-11-15 17:24:01	nasd4	and now i am at home and want to cofigure it
2017-11-15 17:24:38	nasd4	https://ipAdress/plinth worked
2017-11-15 17:24:54	nasd4	then i could add the certificate to firefow

2017-11-15 17:25:20	nasd4	Apache/2.4.27 (Debian) Server at 31.19.xxx.xxx Port 443
2017-11-15 17:25:29	nasd4	so yes
2017-11-15 17:26:35	nasd4	i am happy that i get to my box with ssh
2017-11-15 17:26:44	JoKe[m]	Ah... it may be because you're connecting through the non-local IP. As a precaution, Plinth tends to be accessible only from the local network, not the entire Internet... not sure how to avoid that restriction.
2017-11-15 17:27:05	nasd4	thanks
2017-11-15 17:27:24	JoKe[m]	So did you change the (network-) location of the box?/
2017-11-15 17:27:52	nasd4	the difference is that i use an old hub with uplink
2017-11-15 17:28:09	JoKe[m]	...instead of what?
2017-11-15 17:28:11	nasd4	i got internet runnung but i think the box is kinda offline
2017-11-15 17:28:38	nasd4	in the other case it was a normal router with dynamic dns 
2017-11-15 17:29:12	nasd4	i still got a router that i can try but that think has a backdoor . reported by the fsf
2017-11-15 17:29:33	JoKe[m]	the age of the hub probably doesn't matter :)
2017-11-15 17:29:58	nasd4	i am thinking about getting a adapter for usb-ethernet so i can put the freedombox 1st after router
2017-11-15 17:30:37	nasd4	it seems saver in the long run, i guess i can control the internet traffic then with the freedombox later
2017-11-15 17:30:54	JoKe[m]	... so currently there's a router, then the hub, then the box?
2017-11-15 17:32:24	nasd4	router internet -> hub uplink -> pcs and freedombox
2017-11-15 17:32:57	jvalleroy	nasd4: Are you running Debian testing? Might want to upgrade plinth to the latest version.
2017-11-15 17:33:00	nasd4	i wonder if that works: router internet -> freedombox in -> freedombox out -> hub ->pcs
2017-11-15 17:33:12	nasd4	stable
2017-11-15 17:33:56	nasd4	i gonna call it for today. i will get the router with the backdoor out and replace the hub
2017-11-15 17:34:27	nasd4	then i will see if i can get the freedombox running acording to the manuel
2017-11-15 17:35:09	JoKe[m]	Unless you have already data on your box, it might help if you do the first start/setup at the network location you'll gonna use it later.
2017-11-15 17:35:21	nasd4	i save the text, but i think the irc is logged. maybe i write my configuration down later on
2017-11-15 17:35:26	jvalleroy	stable doesn't have plinth 0.14
2017-11-15 17:36:56	nasd4	Architecture: all
2017-11-15 17:36:56	nasd4	Version: 0.14.0+ds-1
2017-11-15 17:37:00	nasd4	u are right
2017-11-15 17:37:07	nasd4	auto update is on
2017-11-15 17:37:22	nasd4	so it is the latest version
2017-11-15 17:38:45	JoKe[m]	... also not quite, latest is 0.16
2017-11-15 17:39:07	JoKe[m]	maybe didn't upgrade yet
2017-11-15 17:40:08	nasd4	thanks a lot , i got to go
