2017-10-31 14:56:42	liquid	hello
2017-10-31 14:57:25	liquid	I forgot: Do I need to run both gateway and workstation in order for workstation to work correctly?
2017-10-31 15:00:49	liquid	Wow, if they log the number of bytes served to me when I visit a website, does that mean if I have a data cap on my internet
2017-10-31 15:01:05	liquid	Or metered internet in general, that I can be traced to that website because of that metadata?
2017-10-31 15:10:22	liquid	yaba daba do
2017-10-31 15:10:35	liquid	helo
2017-10-31 15:10:52	dnull	liquid: Yes, both need to run
2017-10-31 15:11:22	dnull	And as for the tracking, all your ISP would see is that you're making connections out to a TOR entry node
2017-10-31 15:19:18	liquid	Even with "bridge"s?
2017-10-31 15:22:43	dnull	Yes, because the packets headed for tor are not going to be the same size as the packets when they exit
2017-10-31 15:25:18	liquid	If I stay in a location for a while, will I start to use the same TOR nodes over and over and maybe have my identity tracked because of it?
2017-10-31 15:26:49	liquid	Using whonix that is.
2017-10-31 15:28:35	dnull	All someone would know is that you use TOR. Unless you do something stupid like login to facebook using it
2017-10-31 15:30:47	liquid	Is the whonix IRC client safer than connecting from the TORB in whonix?
2017-10-31 15:32:57	liquid	* connecting to the irc from the TORB
2017-10-31 15:32:58	dnull	They both go over TOR. So unless you know of a 0day in Hexchat, about the same
2017-10-31 15:39:13	AndyS2_	It's probably quite hard to use IRC with Tor while staying anonymous. Exit Nodes might be able to correlate your irc nicknames with what you look up on the clearnet.
2017-10-31 15:39:28	AndyS2_	(So you are pseudonymous at best)
2017-10-31 15:39:48	dnull	That's why you don't use the same nicks
2017-10-31 15:39:52	AndyS2_	I'm unsure if that's really the case, btw. Maybe the circuit selection algorithm works differently than I remember.
2017-10-31 15:39:53	dnull	That's just opsec
2017-10-31 15:40:01	AndyS2_	still only pseudonymous :)
2017-10-31 15:40:12	AndyS2_	a change of nicks every time you connect might be better
2017-10-31 15:40:21	liquid	meh, random character generator from local air interference, I'll get a psuoname ;)
2017-10-31 15:40:21	AndyS2_	and even then you can look at how somebody types/what spelling errors they make
2017-10-31 15:40:22	dnull	Even better
2017-10-31 15:40:47	liquid	Does whonix have docs on it's IRC?
2017-10-31 15:40:52	liquid	* IRC client
2017-10-31 15:40:53	dnull	https://github.com/psal/anonymouth
2017-10-31 15:46:03	liquid	My whonix is suddenly super slow
2017-10-31 15:46:09	liquid	I visited a 0day website
2017-10-31 15:46:17	liquid	LInked? Or just lag?
