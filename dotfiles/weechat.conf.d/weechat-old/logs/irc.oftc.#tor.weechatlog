I found out that this happens when I turn on the hardware acceleration in the Tor Browser settings. Why does not the Tor browser start when I enable this feature?

2017-10-30 10:16:14	popup	there's a good chance it's because the hardware acceleration feature is dangerous for anonymity.
2017-10-30 10:16:22	popup	it is not officially supported.
2017-10-30 10:17:18	FredHeav	But it is in the browser settings
2017-10-30 10:18:11	popup	so? you aren't supposed to change browser settings, with the sole exception of the security slider.
2017-10-30 10:18:38	popup	tor browser is based on firefox, which has a lot of settings, some supported and some unsupported by tor project. tor project isn't going to remove every setting that is not officially supported.
2017-10-30 10:19:59	FredHeav	And why does tor browser crash? Suppose he does not support them, why should I make a mistake? The browser could ignore my firefox settings
2017-10-30 10:21:00	popup	no clue why it crashes. because it's not tested with hardware acceleration, no one is there to debug such a crash. and yes i suppose it could ignore user settings, but that's generally not a good idea. it's better to just say something is supported than to actually disable it by force.

2017-10-30 10:21:46	FredHeav	In addition, this is misleading users. It would be possible to cut out unnecessary settings from the interface

2017-10-30 22:11:09	or56	the question is wheter executing the exe as usual would leave "traces" like installing a program would

2017-10-30 22:12:28	or56	not bothered by that
2017-10-30 22:12:45	cacahuatl	you've got a pretty bad idea of "traces", then.

BTW, I blocked the relay 91.121.23.100 in my firewall and since then Tor is running a _lot_ faster and never chokes, as compared to before when it wouldn't even load sites. I noticed it in my Tor connections as it always wanted to connect to it. And as soon as I closed the connection Tor would mediately reconnect to it. The speed was always really slow to that particular relay as well. So, why is it that Tor "needs" it when clearly it

2017-10-31 00:07:41	cacahuatl	Yes, that is your guard.
2017-10-31 00:07:56	ThurahT	it is a lousy guard.
2017-10-31 00:07:58	cacahuatl	duncan: https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/proposals/271-another-guard-selection.txt
2017-10-31 00:08:13	cacahuatl	ThurahT: It looks fine, so it's likely local to your internet connection.
2017-10-31 00:08:54	ThurahT	yeah. That is my issue.. I just thought Tor could choose faster guards somehow.
2017-10-31 00:09:53	ThurahT	oh well, I solved it in my firewall and now all is good regarding speed. Now I know it is something Tor has no way of knowing.

2017-10-31 00:10:18	pastly	Your guard selection is weighted by bandwidth, but that just means you're more likely to big a fast guard than a slow one. Doesn't mean you're promosied a fast one. And just because it is capable of a lot of bw, doesn't mean you will be able to see it.
2017-10-31 00:10:28	pastly	more likely to *pick*
2017-10-31 00:10:49	ThurahT	indeed. Thanks for clarifying.
2017-10-31 00:10:57	pastly	The two relays on that IP have relatively high advertised bandwidths. Sucks you don't like them, but Tor is working as intended.

2017-10-31 00:11:54	ThurahT	yeah, it was pretty awful. I couldn't reach sites and youtube was useless above 360p.
2017-10-31 00:12:17	ThurahT	it felt like dialup.
2017-10-31 00:12:59	cacahuatl	ah, i see you have never experienced dial-up
2017-10-31 00:13:24	ThurahT	sure have. My first one was a us robotics 33.6
2017-10-31 00:13:57	cacahuatl	then you know that youtube working at all is clearly orders of magnitude faster than dial-up
2017-10-31 00:14:54	ThurahT	disregard youtube then. I couldn't even load reddit.
2017-10-31 00:15:04	duncan	could you load bash.org?
2017-10-31 00:15:19	duncan	That works in the very first web browser, on NeXTStep, to this day

2017-10-31 07:37:05	Squarty1	i know but it bothers
2017-10-31 07:37:14	ryonaloli	do you want to remove all logs?
2017-10-31 07:37:16	Squarty1	no
2017-10-31 07:37:19	Squarty1	just remove

2017-10-31 07:37:29	ryonaloli	there's no way to remove only a specific line
2017-10-31 07:37:47	Squarty1	i know
2017-10-31 07:37:49	ryonaloli	you could set it to ignore everything up to and including the warn severity, but that will remove a *lot*
2017-10-31 07:37:57	ryonaloli	you should see if your syslog daemon has the ability to filter a specific line
2017-10-31 07:37:59	ryonaloli	i know rsyslog does at least
2017-10-31 07:38:20	Squarty1	i have thought ProtocolWarning option could help
2017-10-31 07:38:25	Squarty1	in torrc settings
2017-10-31 07:39:15	ryonaloli	no. that will turn *more* things into warnings

2017-10-31 15:48:20	pastly	yeah. That's a feature in gitweb that can be enabled.
2017-10-31 15:48:28	pastly	I'm guessing it was disabled on purpose
2017-10-31 15:48:48	gman999	yes... that archive. is same/similar to dist.
2017-10-31 15:48:58	gman999	that would be great... should i ping talk@?
2017-10-31 15:49:03	gman999	there must be some reason behind it
2017-10-31 15:49:14	janna	what is the point of hosting a mirror of the torprojects website on an .onion when downloading the tor browser bundles is being downloaded from the clearnet website
2017-10-31 15:49:50	pastly	gman999: sure. I can make a wild guess that it was bots putting too much load on the host.
2017-10-31 15:50:01	gman999	that would make sense pastly
2017-10-31 15:50:15	gman999	but enabling it would make torbsd much happier :)

2017-10-31 15:53:40	gman999	ah.  well, there is still a point in having the .onion, but yes, seems that downloads should be there too
2017-10-31 15:54:31	pastly	ah I misunderstood the question
2017-10-31 15:55:00	janna	gman999: http://expyuzz4wqqyqhjn.onion/download/download-easy.html.en
2017-10-31 15:55:04	pastly	perhaps a ticket should be opened
2017-10-31 15:55:17	janna	try download yourself, it downloads from dist.torproject.org:443
2017-10-31 15:55:24	pastly	The link is for a *onion but the download actually goes to dist.tp.o
2017-10-31 15:55:50	gman999	i see.  yes.  file a ticket maybe.  there might be a reason.
2017-10-31 15:56:13	gman999	binary downloads over .onions aren't often a good idea, but certainly valid in this case, i'd think

2017-10-31 16:36:45	batnas	Hey everybody, quick question: I'm running a relay, and i was reading about some new versions of tor. What is the difference between the "branches" of tor versions ( 0.3.1.x, 0.3.0.x, 0.2.9.x & 0.2.8.x) ? What effect will it have to my relay if i upgrade from 0.2.9.x to 0.3.1.x ? Are the different branches compatible ?
2017-10-31 16:37:29	gman999	i dont have any issues jumping branches/versions.
2017-10-31 16:37:43	gman999	the package is pretty self-contained

2017-10-31 16:42:13	Peng	Like any software, the difference is they have new features. I can't think of anything critical, except for v3 onion services, which isn't very relevant to /relay/ operators.
2017-10-31 16:42:27	Peng	/Eventually/ the older versions will be dropped for some reason or another. Someday you'll have to upgrade.

2017-10-31 16:44:46	batnas	I'm on CentOS, and i apply security updates. There is nothing new ATM.

2017-10-31 17:01:19	Cerebral	Hello.
2017-10-31 17:01:45	Cerebral	Let's say i have a VPS which is in Tor.
2017-10-31 17:01:59	Cerebral	And i connect to it with torrified SSH?
2017-10-31 17:02:10	Cerebral	Counts as double-torring?
2017-10-31 17:02:51	khaleesi2	a vps which is in tor? what does that mean? lol
2017-10-31 17:03:45	Cerebral	A Darknet VPS.
2017-10-31 17:03:59	khaleesi2	like with a hidden service?
2017-10-31 17:04:27	Cerebral	Ye.
2017-10-31 17:04:33	khaleesi2	if you are using ssh to connect to the hidden service of the VPS, then no thats not double-torring
2017-10-31 17:04:34	Cerebral	Know what?
2017-10-31 17:04:41	Cerebral	Scratch that.
2017-10-31 17:05:02	Cerebral	Hmm.
2017-10-31 17:06:00	khaleesi2	cause like, that's what hidden service/onion links are designed to be for

2017-10-31 17:07:17	Cerebral	Which is a hidden service or browsing the Deep Web?
2017-10-31 17:07:33	khaleesi2	its not possible for you to not torify ssh and connect to a hidden service onion link
2017-10-31 17:07:45	khaleesi2	what you are asking is required for you to do, to connect at all
2017-10-31 17:08:11	Cerebral	Oh.
2017-10-31 17:08:19	khaleesi2	say you have link ewqesads.onion or whatever, you cannot connect to this in the clear. you HAVE to use tor
2017-10-31 17:08:25	Cerebral	So it is considered double-torring.
2017-10-31 17:08:26	khaleesi2	be it torified http, or torified ssh
2017-10-31 17:08:28	khaleesi2	no
2017-10-31 17:08:33	khaleesi2	its not considered double-torring
2017-10-31 17:08:44	khaleesi2	its considered required

2017-10-31 23:00:29	arma	that depends on a lot of important details
2017-10-31 23:00:43	sinsalov	contry: poland
2017-10-31 23:00:47	arma	get more people to use it? teach more people about why it's not scary?
2017-10-31 23:00:51	arma	i think there are many tor users in poland
2017-10-31 23:00:54	sinsalov	environment: school
2017-10-31 23:00:58	arma	what makes you think it is -- oh
2017-10-31 23:01:17	arma	in that case, it depends on your adversary
2017-10-31 23:01:30	arma	do they know how to look for tor usage? do they know about pluggable transports?
2017-10-31 23:01:53	arma	(https://metrics.torproject.org/userstats-relay-country.html?start=2017-08-02&end=2017-10-31&country=pl&events=off shows some tens of thousands of daily users from poland)

2017-10-31 23:03:36	sinsalov	teaching staff have very limited computer knowledge except it teacher
2017-10-31 23:04:01	arma	one thing to worry about is what dpi boxes they might use
2017-10-31 23:04:12	arma	that is, if they buy something and plug it in and it identifies tor users or pluggable transport users
